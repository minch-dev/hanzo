# This extension is a work in progress that isn't quite ready to be published in play store or anywhere else.
It's only here to show off for now ^_^. The code is copyrighted and I don't license it in any way.

# Ħ is for Hanzō!
This is an extension that translates Chinese/Japanese Kanji/Hanzi and cuts them down to primitives all the way to radicals. Works with YT subtitles as of this stage of development. Has built in dictionary and composition database, can request results from Google translate on the go as well.

# Planned:
- TTS engine pronounciation
- Translate any selectable text on any webpage
- Personal notes
- Kanji usage stats
